Introduction
Brain tissue segmentation is a crucial step in medical image analysis, aiding in the identification and understanding of various neurological conditions. This project employs two unsupervised machine learning clustering models (KMeans, GMM) for preliminary segmentation, followed by a supervised deep learning model (MONAI UNet) for fine-grained classification.

Setup
