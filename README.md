**Brain Tissue Segmentation**

**Overview**

This project focuses on the segmentation of brain tissue using a combination of unsupervised machine learning clustering models (KMeans, GMM) and a supervised deep learning model (MONAI UNet). The goal is to accurately classify different brain tissue types in medical imaging data.

**Introduction**
Brain tissue segmentation is a crucial step in medical image analysis, aiding in the identification and understanding of various neurological conditions. This project employs two unsupervised machine learning clustering models (KMeans, GMM) for preliminary segmentation, followed by a supervised deep learning model (MONAI UNet) for fine-grained classification.
